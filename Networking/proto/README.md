# About the proto Folder
This folder contains the .cs class generated from *.proto files by the protobuf-net.Protogen tool. These .cs classes must be currently be regenerated by hand. Eventually we should automate this. For manual steps, see instructions below.

## Requirements
`dotnet tool install --global protobuf-net.Protogen --version 3.0.101`

## To Build (in this folder)
`protogen --csharp_out=. *.proto`
